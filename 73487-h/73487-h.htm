</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
[Here is a fine human interest story about the Women’s Reformatory Prison in Massachusetts, and the
remarkable success the inmates achieved in “The Pirates of Penzance.” The story is from the New York
Times of June 21.]<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
</p>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When a felon’s not engaged in his employment,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This sums up pretty fairly an affair at
Sherborn a few days ago. Sung by the
ordinary policeman chorus of any ordinary
Gilbert and Sullivan revival, the sentiment
would seem trite enough. Sung
by the felonious themselves, by forgers,
by the “enterprising burglars,” it takes
on a keener significance. It comes home.</p>

<p>It was an amazed audience that sat in
the chapel of the Women’s Prison at
Sherborn, Mass., and listened to “The
Pirates of Penzance,” presented by fifty-five
of the two hundred women who are
“doing time.” It was an audience which
did not always get its cue as promptly
as an audience should, for in several
places where the Gilbert and Sullivan
Company intended it should laugh it
openly dabbed its eyes with handkerchief
or blew nose violently.</p>

<p>In the first place, it had gasped over
the grim humor of “The Pirates of Penzance”
as presented by a set of offenders
against property and public order anyway.
It gasped again when a lusty opening
chorus of attractive “pirates” demanded
that somebody pour, oh, pour,
the pirate sherry—for it was “sherry”
that landed on a lot of them in Sherborn.
And it could not for the life of it smile
when the jolly pirates explained to it
that,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Although our dark career</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Sometimes involves the crime of stealing,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>
<p>And a few in the audience realized
that the pretty little Mabel, with her
long, dark curls and her clear soprano
voice, was an old offender, serving her
third term at Sherborn. A few remembered,
not without a shiver, that the pirate
at the end of the row, splendid in a
blue and white striped cape slung from
his—her—shoulder, a dagger stuck in
her belt, had assisted at having her husband
cut up in pieces, and, missing the
electric chair by a minute and a half, was
here in Sherborn for life.</p>

<p>It was hard to realize that one was
within prison walls. These girls, most
of them girls of the streets, supposedly
the “dregs” of society, looked and acted
like anything but dregs. Accustomed to
the cheapest sort of music, the cheapest
sort of amusement before they came
here, they had nevertheless entered into
the Gilbert and Sullivan spirit. They
managed the difficult choruses superbly;
they attacked their recitatives with understanding.</p>

<p>They had been branded, most of them,
as unmanageables, incorrigibles. Yet
they had been trained to a point of almost
complete co-operation. The mentally
defective were not only managing
difficult alto, but getting around the preposterous
vocabulary of the “Pirates,”
such as the square on the hypotenuse
and the crimes of Heliogabalus. And
more than one in that audience leaned
over to say to his neighbor: “If they
can be trained to do this, they can certainly
be trained to do something else.”</p>

<p>It was this realization that brought the
audience, made up for the most part of
prominent social workers and city officials
from Boston, to its feet at the closing
ensemble with all fifty-five on the
stage. Policemen and pirates took off
their hats and waved to the applauding
audience that crowded around the stage,
and the audience clapped and waved
back. It was a recognition of a fact that
both sides too often forget, the fact that
criminals are not, after all, so different
from non-criminals. It is largely because
the criminal does not realize his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
relation to the rest of society that he
breaks with it, and as for society, it forgot
the human bond when it began clapping
its offenders into dungeons and
treating them as complete aberrations.</p>

<p>Mrs. Perle Wilkinson is the reason
why Gilbert and Sullivan have invaded
Sherborn. Mrs. Wilkinson’s official title
is “chaplain.” But no chaplain ever took
to himself such an amazing set of duties,
and Mrs. Wilkinson admits the name
must be changed.</p>

<p>Probably the girls themselves, as they
rehearsed for the past eight or nine
months under the “chaplain’s” direction,
have not realized that they were enjoying
an advantage which no other amateur
performers in the country could
command. For Saturday’s production
of “The Pirates of Penzance” contained
the original “business”—the “business”
witnessed by those of us who saw the
first presentation of the Gilbert and Sullivan
operas in this country.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilkinson was one-time chorus
mistress for the D’Oyly Carte troupe,
her husband singing the principal baritone
roles. She has for many years had
experience in chorus and choir training,
and in addition had charge of the House
of Refuge at Randall’s Island at the time
when both boys and girls were admitted
to that institution. It is a curious combination,
and one which has brought results
of the most amazing nature.</p>

<p>The girls have been working since
September on the “Pirates.” It should
not by rights have taken so long, explained
Mrs. Wilkinson, but the voices
were in bad shape. Most of them were
hard and inflexible, patterned on the nasal
attainments of the cheap vaudeville
performer. An understanding of the
music had slowly to be created. Then,
just as everything was within a few
weeks of completion, the parole board
would descend and release the chief soloist
and five or six of the best voices in
the chorus, and work would have to be
begun all over again.</p>

<p>This might have happened a week or
so ago, for the prima donna’s time had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
expired and she was free to go. Which
would have meant that “Pirates” would
again have been postponed, probably for
a much longer time, for Mabel’s part is
difficult and requires a real voice. Mabel
sent word to her family and stayed
another week.</p>

<p>It was not only the fifty-five who actually
took part in the opera who presented
the “Pirates.” The whole prison,
two hundred women, gave it. Long ago
khaki skirts and blue prison dresses were
piled up on one side of the machine
room, and the most amazing materials
took their place. Turkey reds and purples,
tinsel of silver and gold, gauzy
pinks and yellows surprised those machine
needles, which for thirty-six years
have been bobbing up and down through
sombre colors. A visitor, looking in to
see those who had been sentenced to
“hard labor,” would have been amazed
to see them putting gold braid on three-cornered
hats, sewing buttons on policemen’s
uniforms.</p>

<p>All the women attended rehearsals.
They brought their crocheting, their bits
of sewing, and sat quietly while the
picked fifty tackled long words and difficult
choruses. This in itself was a big
concession. The women were all supposed
to be in their rooms, and it was
argued that they would be restless and
unmanageable, given so much liberty.
But they weren’t. They looked forward
with the keenest enjoyment to the rehearsals,
and it was because the company
was accustomed to playing before an audience
that not a member showed the
slightest evidence of “stage fright,” or
even of self-consciousness, at the final
performance.</p>

<p>While the performance was going on
the rest of the women were working on
the prison grounds, in the kitchen, in
the laundry, in the machine rooms, but
they were as excited about the event as
though they were to be present. Whenever
a matron appeared, or Mrs. Hodder,
the head of the prison, stopped to
say a word to them, they asked eagerly
about the guests, were there many
of them, had the Governor arrived, did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
they get a sword for the Major General?</p>

<p>Upstairs in the chapel a squad of girls
worked for several hours before the performance,
setting the stage. The scenery
had been painted by the girls themselves
and would have done credit to
Granville Barker. Towering rocks, a
rolling ocean in the back, a cave that
looked as though it might harbor any
number of murderous pirates, and real
trees. Little birches had been cut down,
and the girls worked long and earnestly
setting them in pails of water behind
“rocks.” In spite of a couple of savage
onslaughts, one from the pirates in full
force with daggers drawn, and one
from the energetic police, the trees
stayed upright with only a couple of
quiverings.</p>

<p>The team work displayed by these
outcast members of society, who do not
fit into our “organization,” was something
of a revelation.</p>

<p>“Get out of this dust, Julia,” cried the
stage hands dragging birch trees to their
places, as the pirate king appeared in the
chapel doorway. “Don’t you know dust
will ruin your voice?”</p>

<p>“Mis’ Wilki’son, don’t you touch them
trees, you’ll get your hands so rough you
can’t play this afternoon,” and, “Mabel,
I thought you was goin’ to lay down and
get rested—you’ll be all worn out.”</p>

<p>“Emma, don’t let Mis’ Wilki-son
sweep the floor—Mis’ Wilki-son, let us
have a matron up here and you go and
get some rest, we can fix everything
now.”</p>

<p>What this means will be realized fully
only by those who know the general temper
of the women confined in our penal
institutions, who have seen the sullenness,
the bitter vindictiveness, the complaining
spirit of the greater part of
them. The girls of the old-style reformatory
or prison have much time to themselves,
and they put in every minute of
it inspecting and piling up their grievances.
Even when they are occupied
they are thinking about themselves; naturally,
they take little interest in doing
kitchen or laundry work, or in running
machines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>Sullenness and distrust, a hardened
suspicion of everything that is done for
them, are the biggest difficulties in the
way of the woman who tries to “get at”
the girls. Mrs. Wilkinson has shifted
the emphasis. She does not think so
much about “getting at” the girls. She
tries rather to get them away from
themselves.</p>

<p>She does not bother with the girls’
little sordid histories. She sees in them
so many voices, so many dancers. Her
mind is intent on just one thing—the operetta,
the minstrel show, the Easter
chorus that is in progress. Her enthusiasm
is unlimited. The girls see her up
at 5 o’clock in the morning getting ready
for rehearsals, trying out voices, arranging
tableaux, planning costumes down
to the smallest detail, as if this were the
most important thing in the world, and
they gradually forget to sulk, and turn
in to work.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Wilkinson and the “Pirates
of Penzance” that brought one of
the most refractory inmates of the whole
two hundred at Sherborn up out of the
punishment cell where she was confined
at regular intervals. There was no question
about it, the girl had a remarkable
voice, and the opera had to have her,
and she would simply have to keep out
of the punishment cell. Which she did,
and on Saturday sang the part of the
Pirate King with a dash and a finish
that brought forth a storm of applause.</p>

<p>She regards Mrs. Wilkinson as her
especial charge. And, indeed, many of
the girls have a maternal sort of attitude
toward this little chaplain, with her wide
blue eyes, her earnestness, her trick of
asking advice from everyone, her intentness
on her work, and her way of taking
it for granted that everyone else is just
as absorbed and just as enthusiastic as
she is.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilkinson has been at Sherborn
a little more than a year. The “Pirates
of Penzance” is by no means the first
achievement. All the public holidays
are celebrated. Last year “The Sleeping
Beauty” was given by the lowest grade
in the prison, in which eleven nationalities
were represented, many of the cast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
being unable to read and write. Fourth
of July is always a gala day, and the festivities
include a minstrel show. This
year the minstrel show, given out of
doors in a charming little amphitheatre
on the prison grounds, was a deviation
from the usual half-circle, end-men arrangement.
There was a little darky
cabin, choruses of cotton pickers, and a
substantial plot.</p>

<p>Every month there is a birthday party,
given in honor of all those whose birthdays
come in that month. An extra dish
is provided for supper, and instead of
regular chapel exercises there is an entertainment
of some sort by the girls
themselves. Folk dancing has been held
under the trees, the kitchen girls danced
“Pease porridge hot,” the sewing girls
“Reap the flax,” and the laundry girls a
Swedish clothes washing dance.</p>

<p>From all this it might be gathered that
we were stepping rather far across the
line and giving our offenders a better
time in prison than they have out of it.
The ultimate object of these entertainments,
of all this work which seems at
first glance rather irrelevant to correction
of criminal tendencies is something
quite different from the mere pleasure
to those who take part.</p>

<p>In the first place, concerted action has
been the slogan for every prison reformer.
In all too many instances, however,
it has been enforced concerted action,
and that is of little or no benefit.
In all the thirty-odd years that the women
of Sherborn have been working in
the shop, in the laundry, on the farm
there was probably no spontaneous co-operation
whatever. The best that could
be said was that they were not sitting
idle in their cells.</p>

<p>The most important contribution
which Sherborn’s chaplain, more or less
unconsciously, has brought to that curious
community is a new sort of inhibition.
Up to this time the correction of
the wayward has been through the medium
of morals. About the best thing
that could be done while a woman was
serving her term was to attempt to
awaken in her a sense of her own responsibility,
of her duty, of the standards by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
which other people lived and which were
necessary for comfort and health and
ultimate goodness. It was an attempt
to get into working order that moral inhibition
that keeps the greater part of us
from forging checks when we need
money, or murdering our enemies when
we hate them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilkinson has a new inhibition—the
æsthetic. Fifty per cent. of the
women in Sherborn are there for acts
which to the normal person would be
unspeakably repulsive. The average woman
is held back from filthiness by her
æsthetic sense, even if she isn’t by her
moral sense. By giving the women who
for a year or two come under the State’s
care an understanding of any one art,
especially of music, which appeals most
directly, a standard is given from which
the individual never backslides. Moral
standards depreciate, but the person who
has been educated past ragtime and past
bad pictures never really enjoys them
again. And while the æsthetic inhibition
has less direct bearing on conduct than
the moral, while it does not always have
force enough to be effective, it is one
more chance for the girl who goes out
from under the State’s supervision to
stay out.</p>

<p>This is, of course, one of the greatest
problems of the penal institution—how
to hold the discharged prisoner to the
standards which she has but just grasped
during her term.</p>

<p>“If we could only keep them here until
we had set them squarely on their
feet,” said Mrs. Hodder, the head of the
prison. “The great difficulty is in dove-tailing
life here with the life that they
meet outside. People are so merciless,
so cruel—they force the girl straight
down again into the life she came from.</p>

<p>“The first practical step which our reform
institutions must take is the creating
of the indeterminate sentence, which
will allow the heads of institutions to
keep their charges until they are in some
degree capable of taking care of themselves.
For instance, in Massachusetts
a sixteen-year-old girl can be committed
to the State Industrial School for Girls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
and be under its custody and its excellent
training until she is 21. For the
girl of 17, committing the same offense,
there is only this institution, strictly
penal in character and sentence, where
she may serve a minimum of eight
months and then be released.</p>

<p>“We have made some advance in this
State in that the Parole Board never releases
a girl if we oppose her release, so
that we are able to keep the girls much
longer than formerly, when they served
the exact sentence and then were discharged.
But it is very hard for us
when a girl knows that her sentence is
for one year and we keep her for two.
She is resentful and uneasy all through
the second year.”</p>

<p>Sweeping changes have been made in
Sherborn since Mrs. Hodder’s arrival
there three years ago. Sherborn is
called a reformatory, but it is a prison,
and, although Mrs. Hodder has removed
many of the obsolete features of it, remnants
of an old penology, she has not
gone to the other extreme and turned
punishment to pleasure and correction
to play.</p>

<p>“What I hope to do,” she explained,
“is to develop this reformatory as an
‘Industrial Training Institute for Women.’
We have had the handicap of
‘hard labor’ stamped on our commitments.
This has tended to make of
Sherborn a purely industrial plant.</p>

<p>“What I want to do before I get
through is to put in commercial factory
standards in speed and efficiency. Up
to this time work here, like work in many
of the prisons throughout the country,
is little more than a stop gap. The training
which the worker gets is practically
no training at all. Hours are long, inspection
is desultory. The worker who
would go out from our machines into a
white goods factory would not be able
to measure up in speed and efficiency to
any but the novice.</p>

<p>“The practical thing to do is to institute
the factory standard, introducing
some competitive basis. Then there
must be correlation with the educational
side of the institution. Before you can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
get up any interest from the women who
sew on shirts they have to know something
about shirts. They must be taught
something about fabrics, how they are
made, how to buy them—the condition
of the industry—which they represent.</p>

<p>“Along with the shop course must go
other things—domestic training, cooking,
hand-sewing, millinery, and mending,
and all of them supplemented by
class-room training. In short, we must
offer industrial training of a sort which
would enable a girl to earn her living
when she leaves us.</p>

<p>“This is the greatest difference between
the policy which we are working
out at Sherborn and the policy pursued
by Dr. Davis at Bedford Hills in New
York State. The emphasis at Bedford
is, I believe, too much on the educational
side. The emphasis on Sherborn
has been, I know, too much on the industrial
side. The two must be properly
balanced.”</p>

<p>The reformatory at Bedford Hills can
hardly be compared to the prison at
Sherborn. The problem of the latter is
much more complicated by reason of the
fact that it is a prison for all mature
offenders, including women of forty and
over, while Bedford is nearer the Lancaster
Industrial School, which receives
girls under the age of seventeen. The
older women criminals of this State are
sent to Auburn.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hodder is energetically opposing
the age grouping which our penal institutions
have followed for many years.</p>

<p>“Segregation and classification,” she
says, “this is the next practical move in
our prison reform. What classification
has been done has been for the most part
according to chronological age, which is
absurd.</p>

<p>“An examination of 427 cases from
the reformatory showed that, should all
women under fifty be grouped in one
institution, the long-sentence women—almost
invariably first offenders, and of
a much higher type of intelligence than
short-sentence women—would be classed
with a large number of alcoholics and
some of the worst of the sex cases, together
with a number of definitely feeble-minded.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
In fact, almost every type
of criminal would come into the under-thirty
class, and by no means are the
young offenders the least hardened and
the most reformable.</p>

<p>“Segregation, as we are fast coming
to realize, must be according to degree
of viciousness and according to intellectual
and not chronological age. And the
classification must be greater. The cottage
plan is the only one by which successful
reform work can be accomplished,
such a plan as Dr. Davis has worked
out at Bedford Hills, for example.</p>

<p>“Under such a system, which allows
for very small groups, the women can
be carefully graded, the downright vicious
woman kept from the one whose
weakness is nothing more than alcohol
or vagrancy. Under such a system we
can care for the extreme cases, which
are always the most perplexing problem—those
violent cases for which we now
have to employ the punishment cell. For
these women, who are often border-line
cases, should be prescribed steady out-of-door
work. My idea is to have a sort
of movable shack and a cage where a
violent case of this kind could have the
opportunity for solitary confinement,
which undoubtedly is the best treatment,
and for working in the ground, making
things grow.</p>

<p>“Of course the prison should not have
its progress clogged by these border-line
cases any more than it should be hampered
by care of the distinctly feeble-minded.
Out of 427 women 17 per cent.
of those below 30 years of age were
found to be definitely feeble-minded, 25
per cent. mentally subnormal, making
nearly half of the number with some
marked mental defect. These should,
obviously, be separated from those who
are mentally sound and given special instruction,
which would be the case were
we to classify according to intellectual
age.”</p>

<p>Sherborn Prison is, because of lack of
funds, a long way from the cottage system—it
is still a prison, built on the dormitory
plan. But its “cells” are fair
sized rooms, clean, and with a large window
to let in the sunshine. There are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
colored pictures and postcards tacked
on the whitewashed walls of most of
them. The room of one of the “lifers”
was unusually attractive, potted plants
at the window, a rocking chair, and a
table covered with a spotless cloth, edged
with a border of the finest kind of crochet
made by the prisoner herself.</p>

<p>And just before lights-out time Saturday
evening it was curious to go down
the corridor and see outside of each
barred door a neatly folded policemen’s
suit and helmet, or a pirate’s gay colored
cape, with dagger and cocked hat on top.
And behind the barred doors could be
heard, in a subdued undertone:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
[At Bellefonte, Pa., the State of Pennsylvania has bought what is probably the most wonderful farm prison
site in the world. The editor of the <i>Delinquent</i> made a recent visit to Warden Francies, and can enthuse
over the site without any reservations. The following article, from the Pittsburg Gazette Times, tells of Francies
and his farm.]<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>Prison reform is to be realized in the
Western Penitentiary now in course of
erection in the Nittany valley, Centre
county, about five miles from Bellefonte,
Pa.</p>

<p>One hundred and thirty convicts with
terms ranging from 2 to 15 years, too
busy with their day’s labor or their evening’s
sports to think of evil, are building
the new penitentiary or tilling the
soil. Only nine hours a day, that time
allotted for sleep, are the prisoners under
lock and key. They go about their
various duties under the direction of a
guard or overseer, but the shotgun or
rifle, usually accompanying such officer,
is conspicuous by its absence.</p>

<p>The prison gives promise of being the
ideal penal institution of the world.</p>

<p>The site is ideal for the work to be
accomplished. It stretches from the Nittany
Mountains across the valley, almost
to the Muncey Mountains, being more
than six miles long at its greatest length.
In width, it reaches out in some places
over three miles and covers an area of
5,250 acres.</p>

<p>Fertile farms in this vicinity have been
combined into one magnificent estate.
In a few years it will be one of the most
beautiful parks found anywhere. Aside
from the building to be erected for prison
purposes, prisoners will build roads
and bridges, remove unsightly objects
from farms, trim out forests into sylvan
retreats and in a thousand ways add to
the work of nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>How long it will take to complete the
entire plan of Warden John Francies is
even with him a matter of much conjecture.
He does not believe the plant will
be ready to transfer the entire prison
body from the Woods Run institution to
the Centre county farm for several
years. While there are 130 men now
employed at the work there, this number
will be increased from time to time, but
he believes it will be several years before
the plans are worked out. Warden
Francies hopes in the future to see the
prisoners of the new penitentiary manufacturing
such goods as are required in
State institutions. He believes that it
would be better for the State if furniture
for use in State institutions were manufactured
in the prison than to send to
Michigan for such furniture, and that
shoes for the State’s charges could also
be made by prison labor instead of the
money being sent to Massachusetts, the
seat of the shoe industry.</p>

<p>Should he be able to work out his plans
with the aid of the State governing
bodies, he hopes to be able to pay each
prisoner for labor, deduct the amount of
the prisoner’s keep from his earnings
and turn over to those dependent upon
the prisoner the surplus, thus preventing
the privation to families and saving the
State and municipal governments money
spent through charity departments for
the maintenance of those families.</p>

<p>Events leading up to the acquiring of
the land for penitentiary purposes were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
by no means favorable. Even after the
Board of Prison Inspectors had decided
to adopt the farm idea, many obstacles
were to be overcome. Warden Francies,
in asking the legislature on February 14,
1911, to pass a bill which had been drawn
up authorizing a purchase of land and
the erection of a penitentiary and other
necessary details, opened his address by
declaring “if the Western Penitentiary
was not a tragedy it would be a screaming
farce.”</p>

<p>The legislature, after listening to his
arguments, passed the bill without a dissenting
vote, there being no semblance
of party feeling.</p>

<p>With the act signed by Gov. Tener, the
matter of a location was then taken up
and in all over 200 sites were offered.
All of these had to be examined and the
merits and defects of all gone into carefully.</p>

<p>The Rockview farm territory was finally
decided upon by the warden, and
when he asked the governor and the
prison inspectors to view that site it was
unanimously decided to accept it. Options
were secured on over 5,000 acres,
but some little technicality developed
and it became necessary to reoption the
big tract comprising 40 parcels of
ground. It was finally purchased at an
average cost of less than $50 an acre.
Payment was made direct to the owners
by the State treasurer.</p>

<p>The first work on the new prison was
done in July, 1912. At that time Warden
Francies took one prisoner from the
Western Penitentiary to the farm and
put him to work tearing paper from the
walls of the old home on the Ishler farm.
A week later two more prisoners were
taken up and the next week four, to be
followed a week later by eight prisoners.
After that the prisoners were taken up
as needed.</p>

<p>The old Ishler home was thoroughly
renovated and changed to suit their
needs. As the number of prisoners increased,
the needs became greater and
last September work was begun on the
erection of a larger building. An annex
was built to the home. It will later be
known as the merit house. The annex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
is a two-story concrete building and is
regarded as one of the finest pieces of
reinforced concrete construction in the
State. It is practically one piece. The
first floor contains a bath room, with
numerous showers, a dining room and
kitchen. The second floor contains one
large room which, although now occupied
as sleeping quarters, will be a resting
room. In the old farm house now
occupied as sleeping quarters the prisoners
will sleep when matters are adjusted
later. Fifty men will find accommodations
in the merit house.</p>

<p>The concrete in this building will later
be faced, giving it the appearance of
dressed stone construction. Every bit
of stone and sand in the construction of
this annex was taken from the farm. In
fact, stone and sand for all buildings and
roads will be quarried on the farm. Only
cement will be purchased.</p>

<p>A pen and corn crib near the home
was removed and the best material saved
and used in the construction of a machine
shop and laundry. An old barn
and other outbuildings likewise furnished
lumber for a power house and
other temporary buildings.</p>

<p>Timber worth $3,500 has been taken
from the woods on one tract and converted
into lumber needed about the
place. It is estimated that a like amount
can be cut from the same tract. Although
the woods on this farm comprised
only a small part of the acreage,
the farm cost the State only $16,000 and
in addition to the lumber taken from it,
thousands of dollars worth of limestone
has been quarried.</p>

<p>With the passage of the act abolishing
hanging, it became necessary to prepare
for the new method of execution. The
erection of the electrocution house is
now under way. The foundation has
already been constructed and is a remarkable
piece of work. This building
will be complete in itself. It will be two
stories in height, with wings of one story
on each side, and about 230 feet long and
31 feet wide. In the basement of the
main building will be the heating and
ventilating system and dynamos for generating
the current.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>The first floor will contain the office
of the deputy warden and observation
room. The second floor will contain
cell rooms and the electrocution chamber.
Such an arrangement will prevent
tampering with the wires from the outside
of the building. The concrete walls
will be two feet thick with an imbedded
network of one-inch iron bars.</p>

<p>This is the first building to be erected
within the acreage allotted for the prison
proper. The entire group of buildings
will be enclosed with a 30-foot high
concrete wall. The enclosed area will
be about 50 acres, or five times the acreage
now enclosed on the North Side in
Pittsburg. Inside this inclosure will be
the complete prison, including the big
cell room where the prisoners will sleep,
workshop and hospital, which occupies
a site on the hill, half a mile from the
railroad and facing the beautiful gap in
the Nittany Mountains known as McBrides
Water Gap.</p>

<p>The site presents marvelous natural
advantages. Spring Creek will be harnessed
and experts declare it will flow
even during the dryest season at the rate
of 100,000,000 gallons during each 24
hours. The riparian right to the State
of this stream has been estimated to be
worth no less than $1,000,000, just 80 per
cent. of the total cost of the entire farm.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
This trout-filled mountain creek will furnish
the power that will turn the wheels
of industry on Rockview farm, provide
the electric light and fill other wants and
still leave a surplus in reserve power.
For three miles up the beautiful valley
its waters will be held back in check until
the time arrives for its use. A dam
55 feet high at the breast will be constructed.
More than six miles across the
farm and up in the mountain is a stream
which will furnish 1,000,000 gallons of
pure mountain water.</p>

<p>The question may be asked, in what
relation does the warden of the Western
Penitentiary stand with his convict farm
hands? He is one of the boys. Could
you but see him in the evening on the top
of one of the great hills near the merit
house during the baseball game you
would be convinced of the statement.
He jumps from his automobile, flings
his coat on the ground and takes a seat
on the grass among the prisoner spectators
and is prepared to enjoy the game.</p>

<p>In the working out of this undertaking
the welfare and future of the prisoner
after he has served his sentence has
not been lost sight of. This is best illustrated
in the words of Warden Francies.</p>

<p>“Our mission is to turn out not worse
men, but better men.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_TREATMENT_OF_THE_MISDEMEANANT">THE TREATMENT OF THE MISDEMEANANT</h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
[This excellent summary of the present correctional treatment of the misdemeanant was read by Amos W
Butler, chairman of the Committee on Corrections, at the National Conference of Charities and Corrections in
Memphis, in May, 1914.]
</p>
</div>

<p>Who knows how many persons are
confined in local jails in the United
States? Who comprehends the magnitude
of the problem involved? How
many appreciate its relation to the individual,
to his family, to society?</p>

<p>The Bureau of the Census tells us that
452,055 persons were committed to
county and municipal prisons in 1910,
under sentence or for non-payment of
fine. We call them misdemeanants.
It is the name ordinarily given one whose
offense the law does not deem sufficiently
serious to warrant a State prison
sentence. If the ratio of commitments
to the whole number received is the same
throughout the United States as in Indiana,
it is probable that one and one-half
million people annually come under
the influence of these local prisons.</p>

<p>We know that jails are the spoil of
partisan politics. They are maintained
largely on the fee basis. Most of them
were built without any proper idea of
the purpose they were intended to serve.
As a rule they are insanitary, they lack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
proper provision for separating the
sexes and there is no means of employment.
Often they are crowded beyond
their capacity. There is little attempt to
classify the prisoners. They congregate
in the corridors and the older and
more experienced in criminal ways instruct
the others in vice, immorality and
crime. In how many such institutions
are women not only waited upon but
searched by men?</p>

<p>The late Samuel J. Barrows once remarked:
“Back in 1876 a committee of
the New York Legislature said: ‘There
is no one source of crime more operative
in the multiplication of thieves and burglars
than the common jail’ and that
statement still remains true of a large
number of jails throughout the country.”</p>

<p>Many of you have heard Dr. F. H.
Wines’ scathing denunciation of these
institutions. Delegates to the International
Prison Congress who visited
this country in 1910 declared our local
jail system as bad as it was centuries ago
in Europe. “Every jail I saw ought to
be wiped off the face of the earth,” said
Thomas Holmes, secretary of the Howard
Association of London, and this was
the general verdict of these distinguished
prison officials and penologists. It was
the idleness of the prisoners, the lack of
fresh air, the indiscriminate mingling,
the long-delayed trials that impressed
them so unfavorably. “I asked two colored
men how long they would be in and
they said they did not know; that they
had waited eleven days for a trial,” said
Dr. Eugene Borel, professor of law in
the University of Geneva, Switzerland.
“That is a shocking travesty of justice.
In Europe a prisoner gets a hearing
within twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>Yet under such conditions as these we
detain hundreds of thousands of persons:—The
vagrant, the drunkard, the
witness, the runaway boy, the first offender,
the hardened criminal, the man
awaiting trial, the convicted law-breaker.
What can we expect but that they will
degenerate in body, mind and morals?
Even where work is provided, as is done
in some larger jails and workhouses, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
is under the old contract system, which
we should like to see abolished. In some
States misdemeanants are employed on
the public highways. However successful
this may be in some parts of the
country, it would probably not be in conformity
with the public sense in the more
thickly settled communities, or practicable
to any great extent in the more northern
latitudes.</p>

<p>The whole question of the apprehension,
treatment and release of the misdemeanant
is of tremendous importance.
While prison reforms are coming with
surprising rapidity, they have been confined
largely to the felon. The misdemeanant
has been neglected.</p>

<p>In the first place, what are the qualifications
of the average policeman? Ordinarily
he is without training or experience.
His politics have usually had
more to do with his appointment than
any other consideration. What part can
such a policeman play in an enlightened
system of penology?</p>

<p>In a number of States the constitution
proclaims that the penal code shall be
founded on principles of reformation
and not of vindictive justice. How far
has that been interpreted in the statute
laws? The provision of most of our
State constitutions that justice shall be
administered “speedily and without delay”
is wholly forgotten. We generally
think that the day of imprisonment for
debt is past. Yet many jail prisoners
are held for debt—the fine assessed
against them. The man of means pays
his fine and goes free; the man without
money suffers imprisonment under conditions
which menace health and morals.
It frequently becomes necessary for his
family to ask for help; sometimes he
loses his job. If he becomes embittered,
or vindictive, need we wonder at it?</p>

<p>The picture is not all dark. Here and
there light is breaking through. We are
coming to understand that the policeman
can be a social agent, a next friend, an
instructor in obedience to the law. We
are beginning to regard as the best officer
the one who makes the fewest, not
the most arrests. In some cities women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
are being added to the police force, and
there are police matrons, and jail matrons,
and even women judges.</p>

<p>“Humanizing the courts” is an expression
coming more and more into use.
Instead of sending to jail men who are
unable to pay their fines, judges are releasing
them conditionally and giving
them a chance to earn the money. The
plan works admirably. Judges are finding
that their confidence is seldom misplaced.
This principle has been enacted
into law in Massachusetts and other
States. Elsewhere it has been practiced
without special authority of law. In
New York State the probation law provides
for the collection of fines on probation
and also restitution on probation.</p>

<p>We are further coming to believe that
too many persons are sent to prison.
Some States have adopted a system of
probation, under which many lawbreakers
are reclaimed to society without the
stigma of a prison sentence. Probation
has been successfully tried in Massachusetts,
New York and other States.</p>

<p>We have learned, too, the value of the
farm colony for the open-air employment
of almost all classes of public wards.
This has been applied to the insane in
Wisconsin, Massachusetts and Indiana;
to epileptics in New York, New Jersey
and Indiana; to feeble-minded in Massachusetts,
New Jersey and Indiana; to
both dependent and delinquent children
in many States, and more recently to certain
classes of prisoners, including all
kinds of misdemeanants of both sexes.
What is being done at Cleveland, at Occoquan
and at Guelph is well known.
The most recent development of this
movement is the New York State Farm
for Women Misdemeanants. The simple,
inexpensive, yet substantial form of
buildings, the freer life and the opportunity
to contribute in part at least to
their own support, make it far better for
the inmates and cheaper to the taxpayer.</p>

<p>In Indiana the first step in this direction
came about through the establishment
in 1907 of a State workhouse for
women misdemeanants as a branch of
the Women’s Prison at Indianapolis.
The institution is entirely in control of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
women. Then the Board of State Charities
began a vigorous campaign for a
state farm for male misdemeanants.
Conditions in the county jails were
shown forth in the following paragraph:</p>

<h3>HOW PRISONERS LIVE AND LEARN
IN INDIANA COUNTY JAILS.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>They live in idleness at the expense of the
taxpayer.</p>

<p>They learn vice, immorality and crime.</p>

<p>They become educated in criminal ways.</p>

<p>They degenerate both physically and morally.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1913 an appropriation was secured,
the land has now been purchased, and
work on the buildings will soon begin.
The law contemplates that the construction
work shall be done largely by State
Prison and Reformatory men. The new
institution is for men who have a jail
sentence of sixty days or more, and
prisoners may be transferred from the
State institutions whenever room for
them exists at the farm. Eventually
there will probably be several such farms
in the State, and this movement, with
proper amendments to existing laws,
should in time do away with the use of
the county jails for the confinement of
convicted offenders, and leave them only
as places of detention.</p>

<p>We now look forward to the time
when we shall have a form of indeterminate
sentence for misdemeanants. The
success of this form of sentence for felons
in Indiana as in many other States
justifies our belief that it will prove valuable
in the treatment of misdemeanants.
Certainly some improvement can be
made over the present illogical short sentence,
which benefits neither the individual
nor the public, in whose name he
is held.</p>

<p>New York has already taken an important
step in this direction. Misdemeanants
between the ages of sixteen
and twenty-one are to be committed under
an indeterminate sentence to the reformatory
for this class of offenders,
authorized by the legislature of 1912.
The site for this new institution has not
yet been located. It is the purpose of
those interested to place it on a farm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
and to make it one of the most complete
and modern of reformatories.</p>

<p>Another needed reform, State control
of county jails, is receiving some attention.
J. S. Gibbons, Chairman of the
Prison Board of Ireland, said: “I tell you
what I think you lose sight of in this
country: That all these splendid reformatories
deal with merely a drop in the
ocean compared with the county and
city jails to which your thousands of
prisoners go, and where many are manufactured.
We were in exactly the same
condition up to 1877 when we brought
county and city jails out from under local
authorities in the United Kingdom.
We found the antecedent to all reform
was State centralization. In 1877 every
prison and jail was put under central
administrative authority, and the expenses
paid out of the imperial funds.
Three acts were passed simultaneously
for the three kingdoms. We then began
at the bottom, closing all the superfluous
ones, and in that way we were able to
close about half.”</p>

<p>I have the following statement from
Sir Evelyn Ruggles-Brise, of England:
“The Prison Act, 1877, transferred the
Local Prisons of this Country (i.e. prisons
for the confinement of all classes of
prisoners other than those sentenced to
penal servitude) from the control of
local ‘Visiting Magistrates’ to that of
the State. The Act came into effect on
the 1st of April, 1878, 113 Local Prisons
being so transferred. Since that date,
their number has been reduced to 56. At
the time of their transfer, the Local
Prison population stood at 21,030—the
highest known. From that date a continuous
fall was recorded until 1885,
when the numbers reached slightly over
15,000. After a series of fluctuations
below and above this number, the population
stands at 15,000 at the present
time. Relatively to the total population
of the country, the figure for 1878 represented
686 committals per 100,000,
while that for the year ended 31st March
1912 was the lowest on record, viz., 439
per 100,000.”</p>

<p>Massachusetts, perhaps, has led the
agitation in this country for State control<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
of county jails. In other States
there has been some publicity in favor
of such action. An offender against the
federal law becomes a prisoner of the
United States and is under the direction
of the federal judge. Why should one
who violates a State law not be a prisoner
of the State? That is the theory
that underlies the new law for jail supervision
in Indiana. Offenders against
the State law have been placed under the
oversight and authority of the judge of
the circuit or criminal court, who is a
State official. This judge may say where
and how the prisoner shall be detained,
and if the jail is unsatisfactory he may
condemn it. He is authorized to prescribe
rules formulated by the Board of
State Charities, which has supervision
of all jails and other public charitable
and correctional institutions. A violation
of these rules, once entered in his
order book, is in effect a contempt of
court.</p>

<p>While these advance steps have been
taken, the reform is by no means general.
Most of the States continue to use, unchanged,
the system long since discarded
in Europe, whence it came. The results
are not reformatory. On the contrary,
they are destructive alike to the
individual and those with whom he later
comes in contact. Local jails are recruiting
stations for our larger State
correctional institutions. We should
make greater progress in reformation if
we did not first pollute the stream we are
going to treat.</p>

<p>The outlook is not bright, but it is by
no means hopeless. The evils which exist
are the natural result of the system
we adopted. Let us change the system.
Let us begin at the bottom and study all
the steps in the treatment of the offender—his
apprehension, detention, trial, conviction,
probation, confinement, treatment,
employment, conditional release,
final discharge. Let us set as our goal:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. A system of police recognizing character,
merit, and efficiency in the personnel
and a proper social view for its operations.</p>

<p>2. A prompt hearing for every person arrested.</p>

<p>3. The establishment of juvenile courts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>for all children’s cases.</p>

<p>4. Provision for the care and detention
of delinquent children outside the jail.</p>

<p>5. A probation system for adults similar
to that of juvenile courts.</p>

<p>6. Separate trials for women offenders.</p>

<p>7. A modification of the present system
of fines in order not to discriminate against
the poor.</p>

<p>8. Classification of prisoners, confinement
of individuals apart from each other and absolute
sex separation in county jails.</p>

<p>9. The prohibition of the use of the jail
for any other purpose than that of temporary
detention.</p>

<p>10. The abolition of the fee system.</p>

<p>11. State control of all minor prisons.</p>

<p>12. The establishment of industrial farms
for the convicted misdemeanants.</p>

<p>13. A form of indeterminate sentence for
misdemeanants.</p>

<p>14. Their release on parole under supervision.</p>

<p>15. The abolition of contract labor.</p>

<p class="h2sub">By Charles Wheatley.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
[In the State Prison of Arizona is a life prisoner who has made a remarkable record. The <i>Delinquent</i>
has followed with great interest Mr. Eytinge’s business career while inside the prison, and now, through an
article from the Ohio State Journal, presents Mr. Eytinge’s story in part.]<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>Down in Florence, Arizona, in the
State Prison they have penned up a Daytonian
for life on a charge of murder.
This man went into prison an outcast
ready to die—or rather about to be
killed by tuberculosis. He had been a
“con man,” forger and all-around crook,
and today, seven years after his conviction,
he occupies a prominent place in the
business world.</p>

<p>The man in question is Louis Victor
Eytinge, born in Dayton in 1878. At
the age of three his parents separated.
His mother was a talented musician,
while his father had been actor, broker
and gambler. Sometime after the separation
young Eytinge went to live with an
uncle. He was educated in the First
District school, Central high school,
spent two years at St. Mary’s Institute
and one year at the University of Notre
Dame.</p>

<p>At the age of 16 Eytinge started on
his life of crime by forging a check. He
went from bad to worse, and was soon
known from east to west and north to
south by the list of bad paper he had left
behind. Many times his relatives kept
him out of jail by straightening out difficulties
into which the young man drifted,
but finally they became tired of this
and refused to have anything further to
do with him.</p>

<p>Cut off from home’s ties, Eytinge became
even more desperate and finally
ended up in the Ohio State Penitentiary
following his arrest and a daring attempt
at a big jail delivery. While in the penitentiary
Eytinge was known as a “bad
one” and when released it was found
that he was suffering from the advanced
stages of tuberculosis. This was at the
age of twenty-seven. When relatives
learned of his physical condition they
weakened in their determination to do no
more for him. They sent him to Arizona
with an allowance of one hundred
dollars per month. He was to remain
away from Dayton and live within the
law.</p>

<p>Eytinge had not been in Arizona very
long, however, until he was under suspicion
of murder. A man with whom he
had become quite friendly and whom he
had taken care of in a financial way was
found dead in the desert one day after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
Eytinge had been seen to leave the city
with him for a buggy ride. When the
body was found Eytinge had disappeared.
He was found later in California
and in his pockets were some of the belongings
of the dead man.</p>

<p>Eytinge was brought back to Arizona
and placed on trial for his life. He was
convicted on circumstantial evidence after
William A. Pinkerton, one of the
greatest detectives of the time, had declared
that it was improbable that Eytinge
had killed the man “as his criminal
bend did not gallop in that direction.”
Judge A. C. Wright, of Phoenix,
who defended Eytinge, was so sure of
the prisoner’s innocence that he went into
his own pocket to pay for the appeal
of the case.</p>

<p>Eytinge was convicted and sentenced
to life in prison. How long can he live
in prison? That was the question asked
by all who had seen him on the witness
stand. Eytinge was near death’s door
at the time. His allowance had been cut
off and he did not have the funds with
which to purchase fresh milk and eggs,
two delicacies almost absolutely necessary
for the tubercular patient. The State
prison was then at Yuma, Arizona. It
was a hell hole with its mosquitoes which
swarmed into the cells that looked out on
the Colorado river. The quarters were
damp, dark and dirty, and afforded excellent
means of killing a man who at
the time was ready to die.</p>

<p>But right there is the story. Eytinge
was not ready to die. He was not 30
years old. He clung to the hope that
something would bring about his release.
He wanted to live, wanted to
breathe again the fresh air of freedom
and hobnob again with the pals, association
with whom had placed him behind
steel bars. Eytinge was still a crook.</p>

<p>Enough of the crook! Let us get to
Eytinge the business builder and man.
It is a great, broad jump we admit, but
the telling of how Eytinge accomplished
it is a thousand times easier to do than
the battle which Eytinge himself had to
go through in bringing about that end.
Seven years ago Eytinge was a crook of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
the first water, seven years, mind you,
and—today Eytinge is a man. He is
looked up to by professional advertising
writers the country over. His business
letters are the best that are being written
today. Eytinge is the star of them all.</p>

<p>The strange part of this great accomplishment
is the manner in which it was
brought about. Eytinge made the road
light for himself. He started out with
weak hands to carry the torch that
showed him the way. Today Eytinge is
his own light; he has thrown away the
torch and walks alone. Honesty is his
greatest asset, and it was through the
writing of business letters that Eytinge
found his way.</p>

<p>When Eytinge entered the State prison
he realized that he must find some
means of making money. One could not
forge checks in prison. Eytinge was
placed in the chronic ward. Around
him were Indians, Mexicans and others
who in their spare moments made hat
bands, watch fobs and other articles out
of horse hair. They decorated these
with rosettes hammered out of Mexican
dollars. These articles were sold whenever
possible to chance visitors at the
prison, but it was a slow way of making
money.</p>

<p>And then one day the big idea came to
Eytinge! Opportunity knocked on the
steel bars and Eytinge was there to talk
to Her! The crude handiwork of the
prisoners was the vehicle by which Eytinge
began to make his way. He began
by writing letters to retail dealers on the
outside asking them to take the agency
for the hat bands, belts, watch fobs and
other articles. It was not long until the
money began to pour in. There was a
big demand for the articles, but it was
the letters that Eytinge had written that
opened up the field. In these letters Eytinge
had given the dealers a straightforward
account of what the articles really
were. He told the truth absolutely and
unvarnished, and one day he discovered
that he had been doing this.</p>

<p>Does honesty pay? This was the question
that Eytinge asked himself. He did
not have to ask others—he had the proof<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
before him. He had discovered that
honesty did pay and that it paid well.
But just at that time this new business
received a severe setback. Prison officials
became suspicious that many of the
letters going out from the prison were
not what they purported to be. Some of
the salesmen were suspected of filling
their letters with fake statements which
were little short of appeals for help.</p>

<p>Word went out from the warden’s
office that each prisoner could write but
two letters a week. Eytinge had been
dealing with forty retail merchants.
Many a man would have thrown up the
sponge and quit. To have thirty-eight
customers taken away in that manner
would have proved a shock that few concerns
would have been able to withstand.
But Eytinge did not admit defeat.
He soon recovered from the
shock and saw that something must be
done. Two letters must be made to do
what forty had been doing before.</p>

<p>The wholesale field was the only thing
left. Eytinge began again through that
channel. And the letters he wrote!
They were full of business from the
“Dear Sirs” to the “Yours Very Truly.”
These letters did not whine. Eytinge
did not have the time nor space for that.
He had to talk business, and he talked it
so well that it was not long until the two
letters were doing all that the forty had
ever done.</p>

<p>In the meantime a new administration
had taken hold of affairs in Arizona.
The State prison was removed from the
banks of the Colorado up the Gila Valley
to Florence, and with this change
came a change for the better in Eytinge’s
health. When he entered the penitentiary
at Yuma he weighed 119 pounds
and now he weighs 190 pounds, is the
picture of health and physicians declare
that he is cured of tuberculosis.</p>

<p>Finding himself had given Eytinge
two things. It gave him a new self, one
of which he was as ignorant of as you or
I, and it also gave him health. The necessity
for money with which to fight off
death had done this and it had been his
desire for money that had placed him in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
a position where he had to get it by some
other means than by placing some one
else’s name on a check.</p>

<p>By this time Eytinge’s letters had begun
to attract the attention of people
other than those with whom he was dealing.
He had become a student of criminology
also, and when Governor George
P. Hunt, the first Statehood governor
of Arizona, began his fight for better penal
laws after his inauguration in February,
1912, Eytinge had published a
booklet of which he was the author, dealing
with this question. A noted sociologist
has pronounced this to be the cleverest
thing ever published on the question.</p>

<p>Magazines soon began to find Eytinge
a man worth telling their readers about.
Advertising booklets such as “Letters,”
published in Chicago; “Printers Ink,”
and others sent men to Arizona to “write
Eytinge up.” In this way he became
well known to men who held high positions
in the advertising field. His advice
was sought by business houses whose
sales forces needed bolstering up, and he
has also been offered numerous positions
as business manager and business counsel.</p>

<p>Eytinge has made thousands of dollars
out of his business since in prison,
but in an article a fellow prisoner has
written about him it is said that Eytinge
is in debt. Why? Well, principally because
he is a man, and goes out of his
way to help others. These laws of ours
give a discharged prisoner a five-dollar
bill and a cast-off suit of clothing when
he starts out to face the world. Eytinge
says this is not enough, and thousands
agree with him, so when he sees a man
leaving prison who is deserving and in
need, he is the first to come forward with
financial aid. He has helped hundreds
of men fight through the courts for their
freedom, and the families of hundreds
of prisoners can thank Eytinge for
money that has tided them over the prison
term of the head of their house.</p>

<p>Don’t forget that Eytinge now before
you is the man who seven years ago entered
the penitentiary many thought to
die. Yes, the old Eytinge is dead—Eytinge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
the crook, has passed away, but it
has left an Eytinge whom the world will
be glad to greet. Peter Clark Macfarlane,
a Collier’s writer, says this of Eytinge:
“They had penned him up to die.
They sent him to jail, a crook, and lo, his
voice was a power for honesty.”</p>

<p>That is the way Eytinge is spoken of
by hundreds who have become acquainted
with him through correspondence
and the few who have taken the trouble
to visit him in his work shop. Among
Eytinge’s first really influential friends
after he got on the right track were McCrary,
the old parole clerk at the prison,
and J. J. Sanders, the new parole clerk,
who was appointed when Governor Hunt
made Robert B. Sims warden of the institution.
Sims had never had any dealings
with prisoners or penitentiaries before,
but he had some ideas as to how
they should be run. One thing that he
remembered, which the wardens of many
States seem to have forgotten, is that
prisoners are human beings.</p>

<p>These three men helped Eytinge to
pull himself up out of the rut. He was
made a “trusty” and given a clerkship in
the parole clerk’s office. These were
about the first honest men Eytinge had
ever associated with. Honest men to him
up until that time were “rubes” and
“dubs” whose money he looked upon as
his own. But in his efforts to help the
parole clerks guide the footsteps of the
prisoners who had been given a chance
through the parole law, Eytinge found
that happiness can come to a man by doing
something for someone besides himself.</p>

<p>Lecturing did not bring these things
about. It was the man’s ability to see
for himself, and his horizon was the prison
walls. Here he saw before him hundreds
of men who had violated the laws
of society, and he saw also that the happy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
ones were those who had violated no
laws but were trying to help those who
had. Step by step Eytinge was bringing
himself up out of the mud. He declares
today that the happiest moments of his
life were those in which he found that
he was regaining the confidence of those
who had lost all faith in him.</p>

<p>One of the best indications of the regard
in which advertising men of the
country hold this prisoner is the fact
that a paper written by him was read
during the convention of the Associated
Advertising Clubs of America, which
was held at Toronto, Canada, June 21-25.
This paper received greater applause
than any other read before the
convention, and the delegates were so
enthusiastic over it that they voted to
send Eytinge a vote of thanks.</p>

<p>The paper was read on Thursday at
the close of the sessions when many of
the visitors were anxious to get away
for their homes, but 300 men remained
in the hall in rapt attention while the paper
was being read. A storm of applause
swept through the hall as the
reader concluded the message from the
man who “puts his brains in an envelope.”</p>

<p>It has been a long, hard struggle for
Eytinge. Will it win him his freedom?
That is the question many are asking.
No one can tell. Perhaps the law will
unbend and open the gates to him sometime.
Those who know him are hoping
that such will be the case, and many are
already doing what they can to bring
about this result. That Eytinge has
hopes that such a thing will come about
goes without saying. He has served the
average length of time that a “lifter”
serves in Ohio, and he is a better man
than many of those who are now released
from prisons through pardons or
influence.</p>

<p>
[Under this heading will appear each month numerous paragraphs of general interest, relating to the prison
field and the treatment of the delinquent.]
</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Ethics of Governor Blease.</i>—The
executive of South Carolina, who has
pardoned 1200 convicts in three years,
has written about it all. Here are some
of the reasons he gives for pardons.</p>

<p>In telling why he paroled a negro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
named Sam Gaskins, convicted of manslaughter,
the Governor wrote:</p>

<p>“This negro, being engaged to a negro
girl, called to see her and in fooling with
a pistol it went off and killed her. It
seems to have been a very sad accident.
However, after a second thought, possibly
it was for the good of humanity, for
had they married no doubt they would
have brought forth more negroes to the
future detriment of the State.”</p>

<p>In explaining why he pardoned J. Allen
Emerson, a white man, who was
serving a life sentence for murder, he
said that the imprisonment of Emerson
had seriously impaired the health of the
man’s sister. “Her life,” the Governor
states, “is worth more to her and her
children and is worth more to the citizenship
and motherhood of this country
than the incarceration of her brother is
worth to the State.”</p>

<p>In pardoning Roland Parris, who was
convicted of assault and battery on his
brother-in-law, with intent to kill, the
Governor explains that Parris was protecting
his sister from abuse. “I congratulate
him,” the Governor says, “for
being man enough to protect his sister
from a drunken husband; in fact, I think
there should be an appropriation made
by which the Governor could award him
a gold medal of honor for his action.”</p>

<p>The Governor thinks that if any white
man calls another a certain vile epithet
and is killed the verdict should not be
greater than manslaughter. If a negro
applies the epithet to a white man he
doesn’t care to say what he thinks the
verdict ought to be, but “people may
draw their own conclusions.”</p>

<p><i>Germans to See Prisons.</i>—An unofficial
tour of inspection of American prisons
and reformatories by Prussian Government
officers will be made during the
month of August. The Prison Association
of New York has been asked to arrange
the details of the proposed tour.
The chairman of the delegation will be
Dr. Karl Finkelnburg, who for many
years has been prominent as a German
prison warden, and who has recently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
been promoted to the position of director
of Prussian prisons under the Ministry
of the Interior, a position which
had been occupied by the late Dr. Krohne.</p>

<p>Dr. Finkelnburg, who will arrive upon
the Imperator about the end of the
first week in August, will be accompanied
by Professor Darmstaedter, of the
University of Berlin, and also by a member
of the Prussian Parliament. The
tour of correctional institutions will
cover a period of thirty-five days, during
which time many of the most important
prisons and reformatories of the Eastern
and central positions of the country will
be visited.</p>

<p>In recent years American correctional
institutions have been frequently the object
of careful study by foreign countries.
In 1910, several hundred foreign
delegates not only attended the International
Prison Congress at Washington,
but made a ten day’s tour, by invitation
of the Federal Government, of many institutions.
In 1913 a tour of inspection
was arranged for four official representatives
of the Prussian Government—Messrs.
Plaschke, Schlosser, Hiekmann,
and Remmpis. During a month and a
half nearly fifty separate institutions
were carefully inspected. The official
report to the Prussian Government of
these gentlemen has not yet been received
from that Government by the
United States.</p>

<p>The German Government is discussing
the proposed revision of the penal
law of Germany. Some of the most
modern and successful features of
American prison and reformatory management
are being carefully considered
in this connection.</p>

<p><i>A “Relic of the Dark Ages”</i>—So the
American newspaper correspondents
called the Vera Cruz prison in Mexico.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Most famous of all Mexico’s prisons, noted
for the untold thousands tortured within its
walls, the castle prison of San Juan de Ulua,
stands today on a little island overlooking
Vera Cruz pretty much as it stood in the centuries
of its existence. On April 28 the flag
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>of Mexico fluttered down from its flagstaff.
The stars and stripes rose in its place as Captain
Paul Chamberlain and a company of marines
from the North Dakota took possession.</p>

<p>In his despatch to the navy department reporting
the taking over of the fortress Rear
Admiral Fletcher said:</p>

<p>“The prison has been taken over under mutual
agreement made between myself and Colonel
Vigil, in charge, which agreement was
signed and approved by Admiral Badger.
There are in the prison 43 prisoners who have
been sentenced for crime, 75 who have been
accused of crime but have not been brought
to trial and also 325 who have not been accused
of any misdemeanor whatever. These
325 were arrested mostly within the last two
months in order to be forced into the federal
army and for no other reason. The above
data were obtained from the officer in charge.
The conditions in the prison under which the
325 men are living are described as frightful.”</p>

<p>Secretary Daniels directed the release of
these 325 men, ordering that the seventy-five
awaiting trial should be held pending investigation
by the American authorities into the
charges against them.</p>

<p>“No stage manager putting on ‘The Count
of Monte Cristo’ could imagine anything more
creepy than the sight which met the eyes of
the American officers when the keys were
turned in the rusty locks and they entered the
ancient vaults,” wrote an American newspaper
man describing his visit to the prison.</p>

<p>In the grim, forbidding, gloomy pile of San
Juan de Ulua the Spanish inquisitors found
a building suited to the purposes and one
which appealed to their torture-loving tastes.
Only a fifteenth century Spaniard could have
designed such a castle.</p>

<p><i>First Field Day at Auburn (N. Y.)
Prison.</i>—Despite several hundred light
cases of Scarlet fever, at the century old
prison at Auburn “on Memorial Day
traditions were set aside when the 1,400
prisoners there were given three hours
in which to loaf or play and enjoy themselves
in the open air,” says the Poughkeepsie
Press. “At two o’clock in the
afternoon they were marched into the
yard in their usual companies, and at a
bugle signal they were disbanded. Then
they played baseball, and participated
in other outdoor sports. There were
cheers for the winning contestants and
a good time generally. At the end of
the three hours the bugle sounded the
recall, the companies were formed again,
and when the men marched back into
the prison there was not a prisoner missing,
and there had not been a single infraction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
of discipline.</p>

<p>“In this instance the short outing was
a complete success. It did not destroy
discipline, nor will it tend to create the
supposition that the men are pampered
at Auburn.”</p>

<hr>

<p><i>Road Making in New York.</i>—In accordance
with the policy of the State
Prison Department and by means of an
appropriation made at the last session
of the legislature, the Department has
placed groups of convicts from the various
State prisons at work improving
roads in different parts of the State.
The plan will be extended as fast as possible
with the available appropriation
and it is hoped that some 500 miles of
earth road will be improved during the
summer.</p>

<p>At present there are five convict
squads on the roads. Three squads
have been sent out from Dannemora.
They are all engaged in Clinton County
one squad improving a bad stretch of
the old military turnpike. Two more
squads are out from Great Meadow, one
working on the Comstock-Whitehall
road and the other on the Ticonderoga-Schroon
lake road in Warren county.</p>

<p>So far the plan has proved most successful.
The convicts are keen for the
chance of work in the open air and the
result to the counties in which the work
is being carried on is gratifying in improved
traffic conditions.</p>

<p>Several squads have been made up
to be sent out from Auburn prison, but
an outbreak of scarlet fever in the institution
has delayed the plan. As soon as
the quarantine is lifted many prisoners
will be put to work.</p>

<p>By the provisions of the new law the
thirty-mile radius from the walls of
prisons within which convicts could be
engaged in road work has been removed,
so that they may be employed in any
part of the State. In addition to this,
for the first time an appropriation has
been made of $50,000 for carrying on
the work of improving roads by convict
labor. Boards of Supervisors of the
various counties are applying to the
Prison Department for convicts to improve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
roads in the counties which are
not included in the State macadamized
system.</p>

<p>Under the plan of Superintendent
Riley the $50,000 will be spent in improving
earth roads rather than trying
to build roads of macadam because of
the much greater use of the appropriation.
Ten miles of good earth road may
be built for the amount required to construct
a single mile of macadam where
gravel or other proper material for surfacing
is obtainable. It also costs less to
maintain ten miles of gravel road than
one mile of macadam, declares Superintendent
Riley.</p>

<p>“After the $100,000,000 to which the
State is pledged is expended on the
State highways there will be a very large
percentage of the roads in the State
which will not be touched by this expenditure,”
said Superintendent Riley. It
is for the good of these roads, many of
them of the greatest importance, that
he wishes to direct the convict road
labor particularly. <i>Hudson Republican,

<p>Several members of the board of managers

More modern methods of conducting
